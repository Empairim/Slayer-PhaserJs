TODO:
//GAME BALANCE
height effects width of bullets thus increasing "spread" of bullets and also will increase "accuracy" of bullets since they are bigger so easier to hit enemies
lifespan will affect "range" of bullets since they will disappear after a certain amount of time so if you want to hit further enemies you will need to be closer.
speed will affect "fire rate" of bullets since they will be able to hit more enemies in a shorter amount of time and it can also affect range if bullet flies fast enough to beat out its lifespan so keep that in mind maybe good for upgrades in the shop
penetrates will make bullets hit multiple enemies so its good for crowd control but have to be careful of being overpowered best to keep on low fire rate guns like a shot gun or sniper

increase game world size and have a snow systems and player has to get to the next checkpoint which is a campfire to stay alive each wave it changes at random
and lower ammo drop percentage based on how good it is so you need to buy ammo and also think about if you want to waste it
